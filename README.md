Project 0 is basic theory for the firstlab with some interesting analysis for runtime of certain algorithms

Project 1 is a coding project that uses dynamic programming to effiently seam carve images

Project 2 is a combination of theory and coding; My favorite exercise was filling a 2^k by 2^k board with the top left corner filled and all the remining pieces being in L-shapes by using interesting problem-solving and recursion. I also enjoyed problem 4 in this which is a very famous coding problem.
